- âš¡ Fun fact: Astronauts aboard the International Space Station must sleep near a ventilator fan. On Earth, warm air exhaled during sleep floats away from the mouth and nose. In space, this does not naturally occur, and the lack of a fan would cause a sleeping astronautâ€™s head to become surrounded by exhaled carbon dioxide, making them choke. [source: Britannica.com]
